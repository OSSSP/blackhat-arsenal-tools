Yalda, Automated Bulk Intelligence

Description

Massive amounts of logs, suspect files, alerts and data makes it impossible to respond everything on daily basis. It is essential to automate process of analyzing files and apply intelligence in collecting data and clustering files based on the similarities. Yalda is an automated bulk intelligence tool that scans and analyzes files with different techniques and algorithms to collect detailed information on each file and extract malicious URLs and domains from each. Yalda categorizes files as malicious, suspicious or clear with a severity of 1 to 5, 1 meaning clear and 5 malicious. The information that Yalda provides on each file could be used to save hours of manual analysis on a single file. The structured clustered results make Yalda useful for analysts, data scientist, researchers and whoever interested in automated bulk intelligence.

Following are some of the domains that Yalda covers:

• Automated Bulk Intelligence Collection tool.

• File Scanner & Analyzer to collect detailed information of the file.

• Collects embedded objects, URLs and Domains.

• Categorizes Files as malicious, suspicious or clear with severity from 1 to 5(1 meaning clear and 5 malicious).

• Clusters malicious hashes and list of associated strings with them.

Yalda results could be used in the following domains:

• Input of different type of feeds such as malicious hashes, malicious URLs, malicious domains, etc.

• A scanning tool for researchers and analysts to extract selective information on a large scale.

• Generating a collection for writing Yara rules on specific malware characteristics.

• Testing tool for testing the capability of your system in detecting and categorizing malicious files.

• A smart feed to cuckoo sandbox that makes it possible to send selective data to cuckoo sandbox.
